eWasteMapper
eWasteMapper is a project aimed at mapping e-waste facilities in Maharashtra and Goa, providing users with information about these facilities and promoting proper disposal and recycling of electronic waste.

Features
Web Scraper Chrome Extension
The project includes a web scraper Chrome extension that helps gather information about e-waste facilities from various websites. The extension extracts relevant data such as facility name, address, contact information, and services offered, and stores it in a database for display on the map.

Interactive Map
The interactive map displays all e-waste facilities in Maharashtra and Goa. Users can search for specific facilities, filter facilities based on services offered or location, and view detailed information about each facility.

Cluster Map
The cluster map feature utilizes real-time data to dynamically group nearby e-waste facilities into clusters on the map. This helps users identify areas with a high concentration of e-waste facilities, making it easier to find convenient disposal options.

Directions to the Store
Users can get directions to the nearest e-waste facility directly from the map interface. By clicking on a facility marker, users can access a route planner that provides step-by-step directions from their current location to the selected facility.
